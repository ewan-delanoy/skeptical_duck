(*

Each uple in the list is as follows :

method_name (string),
old_fw_present (bool),
list of other args (string list),
optional returned data (string option)

The last element of the uple is preceded by a +
when the method is not present in the Fw_with_small_details
version, and must therefore be added (in the Entrance
submodule).
